If you want the full demonstration files download the zip files listed above as they show 2 photos of my Arma 3 character converted to a completely different 2D graphical style and also show that my original characters graphical style being changed is a simple process

"Arma 3 Custom head and Hairstyle Cartoon Model.zip" This show I can do 2D animations and work with 2D characters with no issue I thow these images into Synfig I can now modify for additional animations

For cartoon version of a 3D character this also isn't a complex process the following zip file shows the result of this.
"Original Character Cartoon model.zip" 

With these photos I can complete my previous efforts with my Character Development Project to create a new 3D cartoon model
